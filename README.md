# OS_Project

This project is an implementation of a Virtual Memory Simulator using multithreaded programming. It generates random processes with operation of either reading from the memory or writing on the hard disk. It simulates the delay of the writing on the hard disk, and the page replacment in the memory using three different algorithms for Page replacment: FIFO, LRU, Optimal. And it shows all the details and the status of the virtual memory all the time.
